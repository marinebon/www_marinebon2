One priority for MBON is to advance global interoperability and use of standards for a minimum set of observations (Essential Ocean Variables and Essential Biodiversity Variables) through broad partnerships. On June 19, Frank Muller-Karger and Gabrielle Canonico spoke about this effort during a “Monitoring Essential Variables” panel during the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Virtual Symposium 2020. [A video of the session is posted here.](https://earthobservations.org/symposium2020.php?session=12)
