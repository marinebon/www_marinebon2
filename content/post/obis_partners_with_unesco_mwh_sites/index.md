OBIS partnered with UNESCO's Marine World Heritage sites in a global project to
study biodiversity. A two-year project using environmental DNA (eDNA) to study
biodiversity across selected marine World Heritage sites by local citizens guided by
expert support, to monitor fish as well as species red-listed by the International Union
for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) was launched on the 18 th of October 2021.
OBIS will play a major role in developing standard protocols for sampling and data
management using eDNA for ocean monitoring and data collection. The project will
apply a consistent methodology across multiple marine protected areas simultaneously
for the first time, demonstrating the benefit of global standards while making collected
data available to the public via OBIS.
This will help measure the vulnerability of marine protected areas to climate change and
estimate the impacts of that change on the diversity of marine life across marine World
Heritage sites, helping to understand global trends and inform ongoing efforts to protect
marine ecosystems and ensure future generations continue to enjoy the services they
provide.
