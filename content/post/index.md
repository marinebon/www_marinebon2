The National Ecosystem Assessment Initiative (NEA Initiative) at UNEP-WCMC launched a new website to support countries undertaking ecosystem assessments. 
The new online platform hosts a range of resources produced by the NEA Initiative and its partners, including webinars, guidance documents, reports, 
case studies and lessons learned seeking to present and promote the national ecosystem assessment process. 
National ecosystem assessments lay out the status and trends on biodiversity and ecosystem services in a given country, their drivers of change, 
the impacts those drivers are having now and, in the future, and the effectiveness of interventions and responses, empowering the consideration of 
the full value of nature in decision-making.
