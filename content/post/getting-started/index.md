*Programme proposal: submitted by MBON partners to the first call for Actions by the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (the Ocean Decade) from the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC).*

Marine Life 2030 will establish the globally coordinated system to deliver actionable, transdisciplinary knowledge of ocean life to those who need it, promoting human well-being, sustainable development, and ocean conservation. Within a decade, Marine Life 2030 will unite existing and new programs into a global, interoperable network, transforming the observation and forecasting of marine life. The network of networks will be founded on frontier technologies for measuring marine biodiversity across regions, from molecules to ecosystems, linking the ocean’s diverse stakeholders to advance society’s grand challenge of achieving a healthy and resilient ocean and the sustainable society that depends on it. [Read more here.](https://marinebon.org/assets/Marine_Life_2030_UN_Ocean_Decade_request_for_endorsement_20210115.pdf)
