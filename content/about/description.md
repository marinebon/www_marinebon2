The Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) is a thematic node of the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON). MBON is a global collaborative initiative that contributes to effective management of marine biodiversity and ecosystem services.

**Mission**

Foster and coordinate a global community of practice for the collection, curation, analysis, good management, and communication of marine biodiversity data and related services to the scientific community, policy makers, the public and other stakeholders.

**Vision**

MBON envisions that observations of marine biodiversity, from local to global scales, become an integral part of observing systems to strengthen the understanding of marine biodiversity and monitoring of associated changes over time, to inform society for sustainable development and conservation priorities.


**Guiding Principles**

The MBON agenda is aligned with key international agreements and guidelines for evaluating changes in ocean biodiversity for sustainable development:

*   The United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development;
*   UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development;
*   Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD);
*   Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) global assessments;
*   GEO BON;
*   Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC).

**Goals**

*   Develop a common framework for high priority observations in the context of Essential Ocean Variables;
*   Promote best practice (OBPs) in observations, data management, and applications to advance interoperability and data integration (DarwinCore), and publication of data in open-access databases (OBIS); 
*   Promote the publication of observations and development of products that inform policies, ocean uses, and research;
*   Facilitate capacity building;
*   Serve and work with the ocean science community and resource management practitioners to achieve their goals, expand their international contacts, and support the implementation of biodiversity observations to address local societal needs;
*   Coordinate membership through networking, communication efforts, and other facilitation services; 
*   Foster the development of international and thematic networks within MBON; 
*   Develop marine biodiversity observing and applications strategies that are coordinated and consistent with fresh water and terrestrial ecologists. 

**Ethics and Values**

As a global network that strives to contribute to a sustainable world where people unite and take action to create change, MBON values diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice in the treatment and relationships between people. MBON celebrates the contributions of people regardless of their age, ethnicity, race, color, religion, socioeconomic status, culture, sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.

We, the MBON members, are international and strive to nurture a global community. We strive for the finest science, open knowledge, respect for each other, and the generation of FAIR data about life in the sea. We collaborate and communicate the value of preserving marine biodiversity, valuing knowledge and inform to action.
