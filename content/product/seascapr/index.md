The seascapeR package provides functions for fetching, analyzing and visualizing Seascapes, a global and regional dynamic sea water classification product derived from satellite imagery by Maria Kavanaugh (OSU).

This package is meant to help nodes in the MarineBON.org network extract Seascape data, such as across NOAA Sanctuaries, for comparison with biological or other observations.

The prototype is currently deployed at GitHub - marinebon/seascapeR: helper functions for data summary and visualization of seascapes.
