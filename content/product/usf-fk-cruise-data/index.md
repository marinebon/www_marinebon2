MBON sponsors data collection to monitor changes in marine biodiversity and relevant environmental properties within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary using field work, satellite remote sensing, and analysis of historical datasets.

Phytoplankton bio-optical and pigment samples continue to be collected, processed, and analyzed at USF.
Phytoplankton pigment samples are collected and sent to NASA GSFC for processing.

Bio-optical field data deposited in NASA SeaBASS, OBIS, NCEI, and IOOS/GCOOS RA.
SeaBASS is a database maintained by the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) for high quality in situ measurements used for satellite data product validation, algorithm development, and many climate-related inquiries.
Archived data include measurements of apparent and inherent optical properties, phytoplankton pigment concentrations, and other related oceanographic data.

MBON has systematically submitted bio-optical data collected during the South Florida Program cruises to SeaBASS. The map shows locations of data collections.
The SFMBON project data are at: https://seabass.gsfc.nasa.gov/experiment/SFMBON.
