 “Sentinel sites” dashboard based on satellite data extractions for the Flower Garden Banks.
 These sites consist of a ring of sites between the offshore reef sites of the sanctuary and the coast and polygons near the coast where anomalously high values of chlorophyll-a concentration, for example, can be detected from satellite imagery before reaching the reefs.
