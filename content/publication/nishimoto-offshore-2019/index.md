abstract: A diverse assemblage of adult reef fishes and invertebrates occurs at offshore
  oil production platforms in the Southern California Bight (SCB). Coincident with
  the initiation of the decommissioning of six platforms in the SCB, the goal of this
  study was to examine how a platform's geographical location plays a role in its
  potential contribution of larval recruits to natural areas. Using a three-dimensional
  biophysical model, we quantified the potential connectivity of larvae, particularly
  relevant to reef fishes, from three offshore platforms to four coastal shelf regions
  where the majority of rocky settlement habitat occurs in the SCB. The regions cover
  the shelves of the mainland coast and islands and offshore banks in the southern
  SCB. The main findings indicate that (1) the potential for larval subsidies from
  platforms in the southern SCB to populations in the northern SCB are greater than
  the potential for larval subsidies from platforms in the northern SCB to the southern
  SCB; (2) there is greater seasonal variability of potential connectivity from platforms
  to the mainland shelf region of the northern SCB than to the mainland shelf region
  of the southern SCB or shelves around islands and banks; and (3) there is consistency
  across years in the relative magnitude of potential connectivity from the platforms
  to the four shelf regions. We conclude that a platform's function as a larval source
  should be considered an ecological criterion when evaluating whether a platform
  is to be converted to an artificial reef and implementing marine spatial planning.
