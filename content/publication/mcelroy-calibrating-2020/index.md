abstract: The ability to properly identify species present in a landscape is foundational
  to ecology and essential for natural resource management and conservation. However,
  many species are often unaccounted for due to ineffective direct capture and visual
  surveys, especially in aquatic environments. Environmental DNA metabarcoding is
  an approach that overcomes low detection probabilities and should consequently enhance
  estimates of biodiversity and its proxy, species richness. Here, we synthesize 37
  studies in natural aquatic systems to compare species richness estimates for bony
  fish between eDNA metabarcoding and conventional methods, such as nets, visual census,
  and electrofishing. In freshwater systems with fewer than 100 species, we found
  eDNA metabarcoding detected more species than conventional methods. Using multiple
  genetic markers further increased species richness estimates with eDNA metabarcoding.
  For more diverse freshwater systems and across marine systems, eDNA metabarcoding
  reported similar values of species richness to conventional methods; however, more
  studies are needed in these environments to better evaluate relative performance.
  In systems with greater biodiversity, eDNA metabarcoding will require more populated
  reference databases, increased sampling effort, and multi-marker assays to ensure
  robust species richness estimates to further validate the approach. eDNA metabarcoding
  is reliable and provides a path for broader biodiversity assessments that can outperform
  conventional methods for estimating species richness.
