abstract: The decommissioning of southern California offshore oil and gas platforms
  will create major economic, engineering, and environmental challenges in the next
  decade. Platform jackets, conductors, and shell mounds often host a diverse and
  productive marine community, and among the myriad considerations associated with
  decommissioning planning, platform operators and federal and state regulatory agencies
  will consider the ecological value of existing underwater structures as artificial
  reefs. In the event of partial removal of platform structure, fish assemblages on
  decommissioned platforms may remain unchanged in areas where structure is left intact.
  However, on the seafloor beneath the platforms, a mound of debris often called the
  shell mound will likely change over time if the supply of falling mussels and other
  organisms from the productive surface part of the structure is removed. In this
  study, we review shell mound research relevant to decommissioning, including mound
  formation, contaminant loads, associated biological communities, and transitions
  following the removal of platform structures at four sites. To address the gap in
  knowledge of shell mound fish community structure, we used manned submersible and
  remotely operated vehicle surveys from 1997 to 2013 to estimate the biomass, density,
  species composition and similarity between shell mounds at 22 southern California
  platforms. We found a wide range of variability in fish density and shell mound
  areal extent. Species composition also varied among sites, with three significant
  community clusters primarily distinguished by species depth preferences. These results
  will help inform a comprehensive net environmental benefit analysis of southern
  California offshore platform decommissioning alternatives.
