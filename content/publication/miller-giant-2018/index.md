abstract: Foundation species define the ecosystems they live in, but ecologists have
  often characterized dominant plants as foundational without supporting evidence.
  Giant kelp has long been considered a marine foundation species due to its complex
  structure and high productivity; however, there is little quantitative evidence
  to evaluate this. Here, we apply structural equation modelling to a 15-year time
  series of reef community data to evaluate how giant kelp affects the reef community.
  Although species richness was positively associated with giant kelp biomass, most
  direct paths did not involve giant kelp. Instead, the foundational qualities of
  giant kelp were driven mostly by indirect effects attributed to its dominant physical
  structure and associated engineering influence on the ecosystem, rather than by
  its use as food by invertebrates and fishes. Giant kelp structure has indirect effects
  because it shades out understorey algae that compete with sessile invertebrates.
  When released from competition, sessile species in turn increase the diversity of
  mobile predators. Sea urchin grazing effects could have been misinterpreted as kelp
  effects, because sea urchins can overgraze giant kelp, understorey algae and sessile
  invertebrates alike. Our results confirm the high diversity and biomass associated
  with kelp forests, but highlight how species interactions and habitat attributes
  can be misconstrued as direct consequences of a foundation species like giant kelp.
