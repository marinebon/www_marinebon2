abstract: Reproductive output can serve as an important metric to assess the value
  of a marine habitat as it combines fish densities, size at maturity, and the exponential
  increase of fecundity with body length. California may permit some portion of the
  structures of offshore oil and gas platforms to remain in place if a \"net benefit
  to the marine environment\" can be demonstrated. Here we assess habitats at 23 oil
  and gas platforms in terms of site- and species- specific estimates of potential
  reproductive output. We identified 17 fish species (15 rockfishes Sebastes spp.)
  that have potential reproductive output densities (no. eggs m â€“2 ) on individual
  platforms that were tens to hundreds of times their average on natural reefs in
  the study area, with the highest potential reproductive output values being observed
  on platforms for all but two of these species. These extreme values were typically
  observed in platform base habitats, and likely result from the combined effects
  of high levels of fish recruitment to midwater platform habitats, relatively low
  fishing activity on these structures, and ontogenetic habitat use (depth-specific)
  patterns that make some platforms better habitats for some species based on the
  seafloor depth where they are sited. However, spatial variability was also very
  high across both platform and natural reef sites, including reproductive potential
  for almost all focal species being zero at the majority of surveyed sites. The contribution
  of fish reproductive potential to the discussion of decommissioning alternatives
  should therefore be considered on a case-by-case basis for each platform in California.
