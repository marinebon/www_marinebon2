abstract: 'Alaskan Arctic shelf communities are currently experiencing dramatic changes
  that will likely affect ecosystem functioning of Arctic marine benthic communities.
  Here, functional diversity based on biological traits was used to assess differences
  and similarities in ecosystem functioning between 2 shelf systems that are geographically
  close but vary in many environmental influences: the Arctic Beaufort and Chukchi
  Sea epibenthic communities. We hypothesized that (1) patterns of functional composition
  and diversity metrics reflect patterns in taxonomic composition and diversity metrics
  in these 2 shelf communities; and (2) patterns in functional diversity metrics are
  distinct between the 2 shelves. We evaluated 9 biological traits (body form, body
  size, feeding habit, fragility, larval development, living habit, movement, reproductive
  strategy, sociability) for 327 taxa in 2014 and 2015. For each trait, multiple modalities
  (specific expressions within a trait) were considered. Patterns in functional diversity
  metrics on both shelves reflected those in taxonomic diversity metrics. However,
  shelf communities were more similar in functional- than in taxonomic composition.
  Beaufort Sea communities had higher functional dissimilarity and functional evenness
  driven by differences in the modalities within body form, body size, larval development,
  and reproductive strategy. These traits primarily affect nutrient cycling, energy
  turnover, and recovery from disturbances, suggesting a stronger potential for future
  maintenance of ecosystem function, and indicating a more even use of resources in
  the Beaufort Sea. The combination of functional and taxonomic diversity metrics
  enabled a comprehensive understanding of how ecological niche space is used and
  how epibenthic communities function in Alaskan Arctic shelf systems.'
