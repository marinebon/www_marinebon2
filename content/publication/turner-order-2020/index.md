abstract: Abstract  Sponges (phylum Porifera) are ubiquitous inhabitants of marine
  ecosystems and have been shown to provide substantial ecosystem services. Despite
  this ecological importance, the sponge fauna in California has received little study.
  Here I use a collection of kelp forest sponges to describe the diversity of the
  order Tethyida in California. This order contains the genus Tethya , which has been
  included in long-term ecological monitoring projects. I show that Tethya vacua is
  a junior synonym of Tethya californiana , and thus all Tethya populations known
  in California belong to a single species. Genetic data from Californiaâ€™s only Timeidae,
  Timea authia , indicate that this species is in fact in the Tethyidae and is the
  third known member of the genus Tethytimea . I also describe the first member of
  the family Hemiasterellidae from the Eastern Pacific, Galaxia gaviotensis gen. nov.
  sp. nov. By combining field photographs, morphological taxonomy, and phylogenetic
  analysis of these samples, this work will facilitate future efforts to understand
  the evolution of this order and the ecological role of sponges in the California
  kelp forest.
