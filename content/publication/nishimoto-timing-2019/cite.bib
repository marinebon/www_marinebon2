 abstract = {Recent pathways taken by pelagic juvenile fishes to offshore oil platforms were reconstructed from remotely sensed and in situ measurements of currents and hydrography. Juvenile fishes comprised 52.8% (16,952 of 23 species) of all individuals (32,080 juveniles and adults of 35 species)
observed during scuba surveys conducted about twice per week at two platforms in the eastern Santa Barbara Channel from May to August 2004. Blacksmith,
Chromis punctipinnis
(Cooper, 1863), and rockfishes (genus
Sebastes
, at least 18 taxa) comprised 95.1% of the recruits. Almost
all rockfishes recruited to the deepest part of the platforms surveyed (26 and 31 m), while most blacksmith recruited in shallower waters. The onset of the recruitment season for juvenile rockfishes (genus
Sebastes
, Scorpaenidae) coincided with the advection of a low salinity water
mass into the channel from the Southern California Bight. Before arrival of this water mass, water at the platforms resembled upwelled, high salinity water around the Point Conception region at the western channel entrance. Settlement pulses of rockfishes and blacksmith were observed during
advective events when salinity decreased in the upper 40 m and currents turned northwestward or intensified in that direction. Two abundant rockfish species [bocaccio,
Sebastes paucispinis
Ayres, 1854, and treefish,
Sebastes serriceps
(Jordan and Gilbert, 1880)] showed synchronous
patterns of juvenile settlement between platforms separated by 7 km. Our findings indicate that currents from the bight, rather than from central California, supplied recruits to settlement habitat in the eastern channel and that the spatial scale of connectivity for some fish populations
in this region is greater than the channel itself.},
