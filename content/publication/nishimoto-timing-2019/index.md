abstract: Recent pathways taken by pelagic juvenile fishes to offshore oil platforms
  were reconstructed from remotely sensed and in situ measurements of currents and
  hydrography. Juvenile fishes comprised 52.8% (16,952 of 23 species) of all individuals
  (32,080 juveniles and adults of 35 species) observed during scuba surveys conducted
  about twice per week at two platforms in the eastern Santa Barbara Channel from
  May to August 2004. Blacksmith, Chromis punctipinnis (Cooper, 1863), and rockfishes
  (genus Sebastes , at least 18 taxa) comprised 95.1% of the recruits. Almost all
  rockfishes recruited to the deepest part of the platforms surveyed (26 and 31 m),
  while most blacksmith recruited in shallower waters. The onset of the recruitment
  season for juvenile rockfishes (genus Sebastes , Scorpaenidae) coincided with the
  advection of a low salinity water mass into the channel from the Southern California
  Bight. Before arrival of this water mass, water at the platforms resembled upwelled,
  high salinity water around the Point Conception region at the western channel entrance.
  Settlement pulses of rockfishes and blacksmith were observed during advective events
  when salinity decreased in the upper 40 m and currents turned northwestward or intensified
  in that direction. Two abundant rockfish species [bocaccio, Sebastes paucispinis
  Ayres, 1854, and treefish, Sebastes serriceps (Jordan and Gilbert, 1880)] showed
  synchronous patterns of juvenile settlement between platforms separated by 7 km.
  Our findings indicate that currents from the bight, rather than from central California,
  supplied recruits to settlement habitat in the eastern channel and that the spatial
  scale of connectivity for some fish populations in this region is greater than the
  channel itself.
