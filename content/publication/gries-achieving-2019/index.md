abstract: 'The Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) is a continuation and expansion
  of the original United Stated Long-Term Ecological Research Program (US-LTER) data
  repository which went into production in 2013. Building on decades of data management
  experience in LTER, EDI is addressing the challenge of publishing a diverse corpus
  of research data (Servilla et al. 2016). EDI’s accomplishments span all aspects
  of the data curation and publication lifecycle, including repository cyberinfrastructure,
  outreach and training, and enhancements to data documentation methodologies used
  by the environmental and ecological research communities. EDI is managing almost
  43,000 unique data packages and their revisions from a community of nearly 2,300
  individual data authors, most of which are contributed by LTER sites, and are openly
  accessible and documented with rich science metadata in the Ecological Metadata
  Language (EML) standard. Here we will present how EDI achieves FAIR data principles
  (Wilkinson et al. 2016, Stall et al. 2017), and report data use metrics as a measure
  of success.  The FAIR principles serve as benchmarks for EDI’s operation and management:
  the data we curate are Findable because they reside in an open repository, with
  unique and persistent digital object identifiers (DOIs) and standard metadata indexed
  as a searchable resource; they are Accessible through industry standard protocols
  and are, in most cases, under an open-access license (access control is available
  if required); Interoperability is achieved by archiving data in commonly used file
  formats, and both metadata and data are machine readable and accessible; rich, high
  quality science metadata, with automated congruence and completeness checking, render
  data fit for Reuse in multiple contexts and environments, along with easily generated
  data provenance to document their lineage.  The success of this approach is proven
  by the number and spatial and temporal extent of recent re-analyses and synthesis
  efforts of these data. Although formal data citations are not yet common practice,
  a Google Scholar search reveals over 400 journal articles crediting data re-use
  through an EDI DOI. However, despite improved data availability, researchers still
  report that the largest time investment in synthesis projects is discovering, cleaning
  and combining primary datasets until all data are completely understood and converted
  to a similar format. Starting with long-term biodiversity observation data EDI is
  addressing this issue by implementing a pre-harmonization of thematically similar
  data sets. Positioned between the data author’s specific data format and larger
  biodiversity data stores or synthesis projects, this approach allows uniform access
  without the loss of ancillary information. This pre-harmonization step may be accomplished
  by data managers because the dataset still contains all original information without
  any aggregation or science question specific decisions for data omission or cleaning.
  The data are still distributed into distinct datasets allowing for asynchronous
  updating of long-term observations. The addition of specific and standardized metadata
  makes them easily discoverable.'
