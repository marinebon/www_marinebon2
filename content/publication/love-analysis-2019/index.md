abstract: Using video transects of oil and gas platform crossbeams off central and
  southern California, we characterized the structure-forming invertebrates (with
  a height of at least 20 cm) found around 23 oil and gas platforms at depths between
  20 and 363 m. We observed 20,357 individual invertebrates, comprising 19,800 Cnidaria
  and 557 Porifera of at least 15 species or species groups. Metridium farcimen (Brandt,
  1835) was by far the most commonly observed cnidarian, forming 97.6% of all invertebrates
  catalogued. The alcyonacean, Leptogorgia chilensis (Verrill, 1868), and the scleractinian,
  Lophelia pertusa (Linnaeus, 1758), were the most commonly observed corals. White
  vase sponges (most or all in the family Aphrocallistidae) were the most abundant
  of the sponges (comprising 38.4% observed). We also documented a variety of unidentified
  foliose, barrel, and other various-shaped sponges. The height of these invertebrates
  ranged from 20 to 80 cm. Taxa displayed a variety of depth patterns. Some, such
  as M. farcimen , unidentified white vase sponges, and L. pertusa , were found throughout
  most or all of the survey depth range, while others (notably the gorgonians L. chilensis
  , Placogorgia spp., and Acanthogorgia spp.) were found over a relatively narrow
  range. Invertebrate assemblages tended to be similar among many platforms reflecting
  species similarities over a broad range of platform depths. Based on these relationships,
  it is apparent that the assemblages of structure-forming invertebrates varied by
  depth rather than geography.
