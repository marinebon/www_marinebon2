abstract: Between 1995 and 2013, we surveyed fishes living around 23 California offshore
  oil and gas platforms (midwaters, bases, and shell mounds) and 70 natural habitats.
  These platforms were distributed between about Point Arguello, central California,
  and Huntington Beach, southern California, had seafloor depths between 49 and 363
  m, and were surveyed between one and 16 times. A total of 1,526,437 fishes were
  observed. Fish densities were highest around platform bases, followed by platform
  midwaters, shell mounds, and natural habitats. Of all fishes observed, 90.4% were
  in the genus Sebastes . Water depth was the strongest driver of the fish species
  assemblages, although habitat type and geographic location were also important.
  Most of the fishes living around platforms and natural habitats were relatively
  small, primarily ≤20 cm in length. Many of these individuals were the juveniles
  of larger taxa or the juveniles and adults of dwarf species. Larger fishes were
  less common and these were most often found around platform bases and on natural
  habitats. Most young-of-the-year (YOY) fishes occurred at water depths of ≤150 m
  at all four habitats. At platforms, YOY densities were highest in platform midwaters
  and bases. On average, densities of these young fishes were somewhat higher compared
  to natural habitats and it is likely that many, although not all, California platforms
  play a significant role as nursery grounds for a variety of fishes, particularly
  for a number of Sebastes species.
