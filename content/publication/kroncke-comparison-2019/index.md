abstract: Data from five sites of the International Long Term Ecological Research
  (ILTER) network in the North-Eastern Pacific, Western Arctic Ocean, Northern Baltic
  Sea, South-Eastern North Sea and in the Western Mediterranean Sea were analyzed
  by dynamic factor analysis (DFA) to trace common multi-year trends in abundance
  and composition of phytoplankton, benthic fauna and temperate reef fish. Multiannual
  trends were related to climate and environmental variables to study interactions.
  Two common trends in biological responses were detected, with temperature and climate
  indices as explanatory variables in four of the five LTER sites considered. Only
  one trend was observed at the fifth site, the Northern Baltic Sea, where no explanatory
  variables were identified. Our findings revealed quasi-synchronous biological shifts
  in the different marine ecosystems coincident with the 2000 climatic regime shift
  and provided evidence on a possible further biological shift around 2010. The observed
  biological modifications were coupled with abrupt or continuous increase in sea
  water and air temperature confirming the key-role of temperature in structuring
  marine communities.
