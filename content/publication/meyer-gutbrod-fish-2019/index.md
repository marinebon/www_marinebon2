abstract: 'There are thousands of offshore oil and gas platforms worldwide that will
  eventually become obsolete, and one popular decommissioning alternative is the \"rigs
  to reefs\" conversion that designates all or a portion of the underwater infrastructure
  as an artificial reef, thereby reducing the burden of infrastructure removal. The
  unique architecture of each platform may influence the size and structure of the
  associated fish assemblage if different structural elements form distinct habitats
  for fishes. Using scuba survey data from 11 southern California platforms from 1995
  to 2000, we examined fish assemblages associated with structural elements of the
  structure, including the major horizontal crossbeams outside of the jacket, vertical
  jacket legs, and horizontal crossbeams that span the jacket interior. Patterns of
  habitat association were examined among three depth zones: shallow (textless16.8
  m), midwater (16.8â€“26 m), and deep (textgreater26 m); and between two life stages:
  young- of-the-year and non-young-of-the-year. Fish densities tended to be greatest
  along horizontal beams spanning the jacket interior, relative to either horizontal
  or vertical beams along the jacket exterior, indicating that the position of the
  habitat within the overall structure is an important characteristic affecting fish
  habitat use. Fish densities were also higher in transects centered directly over
  a vertical or horizontal beam relative to transects that did not contain a structural
  element. These results contribute to the understanding of fish habitat use on existing
  artificial reefs, and can inform platform decommissioning decisions as well as the
  design of new offshore structures intended to increase fish production.'
