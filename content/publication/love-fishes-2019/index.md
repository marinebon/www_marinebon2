abstract: "This paper serves as an introduction to a symposium on the role that California\
  \ oil and gas platforms serve as habitats for fishes and invertebrates. As of 2019,\
  \ there are 27 platforms in state and federal waters off California, and the decommissioning\
  \ of some of these platforms is imminent. Thus, consideration of whether to completely\
  \ remove a platform or cut it off at some depth below the sea surface and retain\
  \ the submerged portion as a reef is a decision that will occur in the near future.\
  \ The objectives of the 10 papers in this dedicated issue of the Bulletin of Marine\
  \ Science are to: (1) increase scientific understanding of the inter- and intrarelationships\
  \ of fish and invertebrate populations at offshore oil and gas platforms and natural\
  \ reefs within the Southern California Bight; (2) determine the extent of influence\
  \ of platform assemblages on southern California and the Pacific coast populations\
  \ of fishes and invertebrates; and (3) synthesize relevant reports, existing peer-reviewed\
  \ literature, and new data analyses into a single peer-reviewed reference. This\
  \ introductory paper contains a synopsis of all extant California platforms including\
  \ information on: (1) the original operator, (2) the current operator of records,\
  \ (3) the date the platform was installed, (4) the first production date, (5) the\
  \ platform's distance from shore [including whether it is state or outer continental\
  \ shelf (OCS) waters], (6) the bottom depth of the platform, (7) the number of well\
  \ slots, (8) the number of conductors, (9) what the platform produces (oil and/or\
  \ gas), (10) the platform jacket dimensions [generally at the seafloor (bottom)],\
  \ (11) the platform's footprint, (12) the midwater surface area, (13) the total\
  \ removal weight, (14) the platform location, (15) the shell mound size, (16) the\
  \ shell mound volume, (17) the shell mound height, (18) the center of the shell\
  \ mound location, and (19) the bottom slope. In addition, we present an overview\
  \ of all previous research on the biology and ecology of California platform organisms."
