abstract: We explored biogeographical and local patterns in the composition of shallow
  water (≤18 m depth) invertebrate assemblages inhabiting California offshore oil
  and gas platforms using multivariate analysis of diver- conducted photographic data
  collected from 23 platforms in 2013–2014. We evaluated the potential importance
  of sea surface temperature (SST) and other physical and biological factors in driving
  observed patterns in these assemblages. Prior to this analysis, platforms were grouped
  into four regions based on local differences in annual mean SST. The composition
  of invertebrate assemblages varied significantly among the four regions, reflecting
  differences in the relative abundances of certain anemone, bryozoan, sponge, and
  bivalve taxa. However, invertebrate assemblages varied idiosyncratically among platforms
  within a region. Variation in platform assemblages was associated with SST across
  regions; however, assemblages of platforms in the southeast Santa Barbara Channel
  were distinct due to the high cover of a non-native bryozoan, Watersipora subatra
  (Ortmann, 1890). The existence of geographical patterns in the composition of platform
  invertebrate assemblages and the colonization of one platform by a native bryozoan
  with southern affinities during elevated SST of 2014–2015 suggest that these assemblages
  may be useful over broad spatial scales as barometers of short- and longer-term
  changes in ocean climate. However, over smaller spatial scales, the idiosyncratic
  differences in invertebrate assemblages among platforms within regions indicates
  that these assemblages would have to be considered on a platform-by-platform basis
  under various decommissioning scenarios.
