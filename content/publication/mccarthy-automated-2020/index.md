abstract: In September of 2017, Hurricane Irma made landfall within the Rookery Bay
  National Estuarine Research Reserve of southwest Florida (USA) as a category 3 storm
  with winds in excess of 200 km h−1. We mapped the extent of the hurricane’s impact
  on coastal land cover with a seasonal time series of satellite imagery. Very high-resolution
  (i.e., textless5 m pixel) satellite imagery has proven effective to map wetland
  ecosystems, but challenges in data acquisition and storage, algorithm training,
  and image processing have prevented large-scale and time-series mapping of these
  data. We describe our approach to address these issues to evaluate Rookery Bay ecosystem
  damage and recovery using 91 WorldView-2 satellite images collected between 2010
  and 2018 mapped using automated techniques and validated with a field campaign.
  Land cover was classified seasonally at 2 m resolution (i.e., healthy mangrove,
  degraded mangrove, upland, soil, and water) with an overall accuracy of 82%. Digital
  change detection methods show that hurricane-related degradation was 17% of mangrove
  forest (~5 km2). Approximately 35% (1.7 km2) of this loss recovered one year after
  Hurricane Irma. The approach completed the mapping approximately 200 times faster
  than existing methods, illustrating the ease with which regional high-resolution
  mapping may be accomplished efficiently.
