abstract: Abstract  Background Coral-associated microbial communities are sensitive
  to multiple environmental and biotic stressors that can lead to dysbiosis and mortality.
  Although the processes contributing to these microbial shifts remain inadequately
  understood, a number of potential mechanisms have been identified. For example,
  predation by various corallivore species, including ecologically-important taxa
  such as parrotfishes, may disrupt coral microbiomes via bite-induced transmission
  and/or enrichment of potentially opportunistic bacteria. Here, we used a combination
  of mesocosm experiments and field-based observations to investigate whether parrotfish
  corallivory can alter coral microbial assemblages directly and to identify the potentially
  relevant pathways (e.g. direct transmission) that may contribute to these changes.   Results  Our
  mesocosm experiment demonstrated that predation by the parrotfish Chlorurus spilurus
  on Porites lobata corals resulted in a 2-4x increase in bacterial alpha diversity
  of the coral microbiome and a shift in bacterial community composition after 48 h.
  These changes corresponded with greater abundance of both potentially beneficial
  (i.e. Oceanospirillum ) and opportunistic bacteria (i.e. Flammeovirgaceae, Rhodobacteraceae)
  in predated compared to mechanically wounded corals. Importantly, many of these
  taxa were detectable in C. spilurus mouths, but not in corals prior to predation.
  When we sampled bitten and unbitten corals in the field, corals bitten by parrotfishes
  exhibited 3x greater microbial richness and a shift in community composition towards
  greater abundance of both potential beneficial symbionts (i.e. Ruegeria ) and bacterial
  opportunists (i.e. Rhodospiralles, Glaciecola ). Moreover, we observed 4x greater
  community variability in naturally bitten vs. unbitten corals, a potential indicator
  of dysbiosis. Interestingly, some of the microbial taxa detected in naturally bitten
  corals, but not unbitten colonies, were also detected in parrotfish mouths.    Conclusions
  Our findings suggest that parrotfish corallivory may represent an unrecognized route
  of bacterial transmission and/or enrichment of rare and distinct bacterial taxa,
  both of which could impact coral microbiomes and health. More broadly, we highlight
  how underappreciated pathways, such as corallivory, may contribute to dysbiosis
  within reef corals, which will be critical for understanding and predicting coral
  disease dynamics as reefs further degrade.
